Assumpta, a nursing student at Godfrey Okoye University whoâ€™s equally fascinated by the world of technology and web development.

While nursing is my core field of study, Iâ€™ve always been curious about how technology can be used to solve real-life problems and make everyday tasks easier. Over time, this curiosity grew into a passion for exploring modern digital tools, learning how to build websites, and experimenting with creative projects that combine design with technical skills.

I enjoy problem-solving, trying out new ideas, and creating solutions that are not only functional but also user-friendly. For me, technology is a space where I can bring together my love for creativity and logical thinking.

Outside of academics and coding, Iâ€™m someone who loves to keep learning, exploring new trends, and working on personal projects that push me to grow. My goal is to merge my background in healthcare with my tech skills to create meaningful and innovative solutions for the future.
